# LAU CS Department Course Scraper
This is a Python script that generates a well-formatted CSV file with details about the upcoming Fall 2023 course offerings for the Department of Computer Science at the Byblos campus of the Lebanese American University (LAU).

# Requirements

The script requires Python 3.x and the following Python packages:

beautifulsoup4 (pip install bs4)

selenium (pip install selenium)

chromedriver (pip install chromedriver)

Usage
To run the script, use the following command:

python lau-scrape.py 

The script will then log in to the LAU website using your credentials, scrape the course offerings page for the CS Department at the Byblos campus, and write the data to a CSV file named output.csv.

This script is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used to scrape data from websites without the website owner's permission.
